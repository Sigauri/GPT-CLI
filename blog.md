# GPT-CLI: Command Line Interface for OpenAI's GPT

GPT-CLI is a powerful tool that allows you to harness the power of OpenAI's GPT, the world's most advanced language model, right from the command line. With GPT-CLI, you can perform a wide range of tasks, from generating code to writing content, all by simply running commands.

One of the most impressive features of GPT-CLI is its ability to automatically complete text based on a given prompt. This makes it great for drafting emails, creating content, or even generating code. With GPT-CLI, you can easily generate a bash script for "Hello, World!" with a simple command.

But GPT-CLI's potential doesn't stop there. You can even pipe GPT commands to other commands, or back to GPT itself, creating powerful and dynamic workflows. For example, you can use GPT-CLI to refactor your code by providing a prompt and outputting the result to the desired file. You can also generate documentation for your code by providing relevant prompts.

GPT-CLI is a versatile tool that can be used in conjunction with other command line tools to process and manipulate text, such as grep, awk, or sed. With GPT-CLI, the possibilities are limited only by your imagination and ability to prompt and string together commands.

In an effort to improve navigation on the site, the author of a blog post decided to hide the navigation behind a hamburger menu when the screen width warranted it. However, they were unsure of the best way to go about it. They turned to ChatGPT for help and received a simple hamburger menu that displays nav with a single ul, li elements as a hamburger menu. The CSS was a copy & paste smashing success!

ChatGPT is quickly becoming a swiss army knife / sous coder for the author. It preps everything for them so all they have to do is follow the recipes they already know! With GPT-CLI and ChatGPT, the possibilities are endless.
