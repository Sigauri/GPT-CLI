# GPT-CLI: Command Line Interface for OpenAI's GPT

Welcome to GPT-CLI, a command line interface for harnessing the power of OpenAI's GPT, the world's most advanced language model. This project aims to make the incredible capabilities of GPT more accessible and easily integrated into your workflow, right from the command line.

## Features

GPT, or Generative Pre-trained Transformer, is known for its remarkable language understanding and generation abilities. Here are some features that you might have already experienced using OpenAI's GPT model, whether it's through the API or ChatGPT:

- **Text Completion:** GPT can automatically complete text based on a given prompt, making it great for drafting emails, creating content, or even generating code.
- **Conversational AI:** GPT's ability to understand context and maintain a conversation makes it ideal for building chatbots, AI assistants, and customer support solutions.
- **Translation:** Leverage GPT's multilingual capabilities to translate text between languages quickly and accurately.
- **Summarization:** GPT can summarize long pieces of text, extracting key points and condensing information into a more digestible format.
- **Question-Answering:** GPT can be used to build powerful knowledge bases, capable of answering questions based on context and provided information.

## Project Intent

The primary goal of this project is to create a command line interface (CLI) for GPT, allowing you to access its incredible capabilities right from your terminal. This CLI will enable you to perform tasks like generating code, writing content, and more, all by simply running commands.

For example, you could generate a bash script for "Hello, World!" with the following command: <br />
```gpt --prompt='refactor this Python function for better readability' --input=original_code.py > refactored_code.py```

But GPT-CLI's potential doesn't stop there. You can even pipe GPT commands to other commands, or back to GPT itself, creating powerful and dynamic workflows.

Here are some additional ideas for GPT-CLI functionalities:

1. **Code Refactoring:** Use GPT-CLI to refactor your code by providing a prompt and outputting the result to the desired file. <br />
```gpt --prompt='refactor this Python function for better readability' --input=original_code.py > refactored_code.py```

2. **Automated Documentation:** Generate documentation for your code by providing relevant prompts and file paths. <br />
```gpt --prompt='create documentation for this JavaScript function' --input=function.js > documentation.md```

3. **Text Processing:** Use GPT-CLI in conjunction with other command line tools to process and manipulate text, such as grep, awk, or sed. <br />
```gpt --prompt='summarize this article' --input=article.txt | grep 'keyword' > summarized_with_keyword.txt```

With GPT-CLI, the possibilities are limited only by your imagination and ability to prompt and string together commands.

I hope this tool will empower you to integrate GPT into your workflow, streamline your tasks, and unleash your creativity.
